A social network exclusively focused in organizing events with your network. When you add friends you get access to their created events and they get access to yours.


Developed for a 24h hackathon as the last project of a 14 weeks programming bootcamp.


Disclaimer: the application will be further developed.


RestAPI done in Java using Spring MVC.
